# REACT BASIC INTRODUCTION


## What is React?
   React is an open-source front-end JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications.
   
   It is used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. It follows a component-based architecture which helps in building reusable UI components. It was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. Due to its high demand, it also has a large community support. 


## Features of React
   Features of react are as follows:-
   
   1. It uses reusuable UI components to develop the view of our application.
   2. It has an easy learning curve because it requires the basic knowledge of HTML and Javascript.
   3. It uses Virtual DOM instead of Real DOM, which enhances the performance of our application.
   4. It supports JSX , which helps us to write html code inside javascript.
   5. It follows Unidirectional data flow or data binding.
   6. Using React native we can create mobile - application as well which supports both Android and iOS.
   
   

## What is SPA ?
   SPA stands for Single Page Application. It means whenever any event is occured in an application then that application not getting reloading , such type of appliactions is known as Single Page Application. When we create React application using CRA, it always create the application which will be Single page application.
   
   And if that appliaction is getting reloading then that type of application is known as Multipage Application. 
   
   #### For example 
   When we click on the button or select any option in navigation bar then our website is not getting reloading in browser it directly updates the content of our website such type of websites are the example of SPA.
   
   

## What is JSX ?
   JSX stands for JavaScript XML which is simply a syntax extension of JavaScript. It is a type of file used by React which allows developers to directly write HTML like template syntax in React and makes it really easy to understand. Basically it helps to avoid writing the React.createElement() function which is the feature of ECMA Script 5 where as JSX is the feature of ECMA Script 6.
